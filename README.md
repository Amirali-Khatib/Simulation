# **Simulation**
The items below are all the projects' titles that I did in the **Discrete-event Simulation** course.
1. A hospital's messaging system is between an emergency department and a warehouse.
2. A barbershop service queue simulation
3. A Telephone station queue Simulation
4. A banking service queue with a single queue
5. A banking service queue with 2 queues

**Note**: All these simulation codes are entirely implemented from scratch without any specific Python's related libraries (except Numpy)
